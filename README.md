As a project for Treehouse React-Basics course, the task was to develop a Scoreboard App. 
State for the player's score, the players array, the player counter, point counter, and stopwatch. A few other stateless componenets were developed. 

To do: study Redux, the state-management library. study Babel which can be used to compile JSX code to plain JavaScript (for this project, however, we use an in-browser compiler called Babel.js a real-world scenario would typically include a build step, Webpack can perform this)
Webpack: more complex build tool (compilation plus a JavaScript module system)
React Native: renders to iPhone/Android
